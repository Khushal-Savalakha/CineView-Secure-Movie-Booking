## 🚀 Features & Usage

1. **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies. If the movie exists, it will display available dates and time slots; otherwise, a "No results found" message is shown.
2. **Seat Selection**: Users must select both a date and a time slot before booking. If a time slot isn't selected, the system prompts users to select one.
3. **Secure Payment**: Users can securely pay via Stripe. If the payment is successful, booking details are saved, and users can download their tickets and receipts.
4. **Error Handling**: If the payment fails or is canceled, the system redirects the user to a cancellation page, and no booking is saved.

## 🌐 Payment Flow with Stripe

The payment process is securely managed via Stripe. If a user completes a booking, the payment details are saved, and the user is shown a success page. If the payment fails or is canceled, they are redirected to a cancellation page.

- **Success URL**: Displays a confirmation message and provides the option to download the booking receipt.
- **Cancel URL**: Redirects to a page displaying an apology message, offering to return to the booking history.
